# E-commerce Revenue & User Insights

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior, revenue distribution, and sales performance based on an e-commerce dataset.  
The project highlights key business insights through visualizations and descriptive analytics.

## 📌 Objectives
- Analyze overall revenue trends and category-level performance  
- Understand customer value, spending patterns, and retention behavior  
- Identify revenue concentration through Pareto analysis  
- Compare conversion efficiency across traffic channels  
- Produce clear visual insights for portfolio and reporting purposes  

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Internal e-commerce transaction logs  
- Variables used include:
  - Order dates & revenue  
  - Product category sales  
  - User spending and activity days  
  - Spend ranges and customer counts  
  - Traffic channel events & conversion rates  

## 🔍 Methods
- Weekly sales trend analysis  
- Revenue share and low-performing category identification  
- Customer segmentation  
  - New vs repeat users  
  - Customer Value Map (AOV vs purchase frequency)  
- Pareto analysis (top spenders vs total revenue)  
- Traffic channel conversion rate comparison  
- Visualizations prepared using spreadsheet tools (no Python scripts used)

## 📈 Key Results (Summary)
- Revenue shows significant weekly fluctuations with several noticeable peak periods.  
- Apparel accounts for nearly half of total revenue, making it the dominant product category.  
- A small percentage of high-value customers (top ~20%) contribute a disproportionate share of total revenue.  
- New users represent the majority of customer volume, but repeat users demonstrate significantly higher average revenue.  
- Conversion rates differ widely by traffic channel, indicating areas for optimization.  
- Several categories generate minimal revenue and may require strategic review or improvement.
